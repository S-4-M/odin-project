      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
        traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
        mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and
        Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green
        salad and crusty garlic bread.
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <h4>step 1</h4>
      <p>put an onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
      <h4>step 2</h4>
      <p>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
        garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and
        simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <h4>step 3</h4>
      <p>
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water
        to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
        and set aside.
      </p>
      <h4>step 4</h4>
      <p>
        While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190
        degrees C).
      </p>
      <h4>step 5</h4>
      <p>
        Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh
        parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
      </p>
      <h4>step 6</h4>
      <p>
        Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a
        9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles
        over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of
        the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
        once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and
        mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
      </p>
      <h4>step 7</h4>
      <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
        bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
      </p>
      <h4>step 8</h4>
      <p>
        Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and
        serving.
